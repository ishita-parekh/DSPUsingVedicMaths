# DSPUsingVedicMaths

#Implementation of  FPGA based dsp (dsp operation like convolution) using vedic maths.

#Coding is done in verilog language.
 
#Code files are uploaded for individual blocks of dsp. 

#URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM SUTRA is used for mathematical computation (There are total 16 Sutras available in Vedic maths for multiplication and addition).

#Image of Multiplication using URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM SUTRA is uploaded as VedicAlgorithm.

#Results of the computtion could be found in Results folder.
